# My previous solution may not be entirely correct
It was suggested to me on ed, that due to the small images, it shouldn't take that long to train. This prompted me to go back and check on the image size, and it turns out I have resized them to around 220, which was slowing down the model. I have no made this change on my code, however without access to the GPU, as I have exhausted it on Colab, I can't feasibly access it until I get some time back with the GPU.
