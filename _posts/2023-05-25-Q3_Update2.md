# Finally realised the problem
I finally realised why my model was taking so long to run, I wasn't accessing my images locally, instead I was uploading them to the drive. This meant that it was taking an extended amount of time for the model to train. I uploaded it locally and now the model is taking significantly faster to train. My initial results are with the resnet architecture, which was very accurate. I will upload the results below.
