# Update on using fastai
I have been using fastai to do question 2 of this assignment, where I have to scrape 10 classes of animals off Duck Duck Go(DDG), and then use fastai to create a model that identifies and categorises the animal class. This is done by using a multi-class loss function. I have learnt several things along the way and would like to share them below.

### **Search terms are important!**
My search terms for scraping pictures off DDG initially, was only yielding me accuracies of ~88%. Although this may seem high, fastai has the potential to train the model to have an accuracy of 100%. I tried tweaking various parameters of the datablock, to no avail. And then it was pointed out to me that a higher accuracy could be achieved, if I was more direct with my search terms. Before my search terms were just the class of the animal, followed by 'photo' or 'sun photo' or 'shade photo' as per the example. However by appending 'animal' to the class of animal, it yielded more accurate results, with the pictures actually being the animal describe, and not tainted by the 'sun photo' or 'shade photo' appending. 

### **Confusion matricies are easy to implement with fastai**
A confusion matrix is useful to help visualise the data and results. Using fastai, it is easy to create a confusion matrix when combined with libraries such as seaborne and sklearn. I was able to create a confusion matrix that I'll attatch below.

### **t-SNE graphs are also easy to implement with fastai**
Like the confusion matrix, t-SNE graphs are also easy to implement with fastai, and it is another great way to visualise the data. You just need to combine your dls, with sklearn and seaborne, and it's not difficult to get your t-SNE graph. I will paste mine below too.

I'll finally be tackling that deep learning problem now, so stay tuned for updates
