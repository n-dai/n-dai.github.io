# Starting Q3

This is the task that was described in the first blog. I've just started to get my head around it, by reading research papers on similar methods, and also forming my own method. I have decided to approach it like Q2. Fastai makes it easy to use different architectures for this questions, so I can examine the performance of differnt architectures. 

# **Initial problems encountered**
My first problem was to upload the 60,000 images onto google drive. It crashed the web browser when trying to drag and drop the images in. Therefore I decided to download google drive for desktop and this made uploading the images easier. The second problem I am encountering is that it takes rediculously long to train the model for 1 epoch. This is probably due to the many images that need to be trained, or the architecture, but after it has trained 1 epoch, I will use a different architecture to test.
