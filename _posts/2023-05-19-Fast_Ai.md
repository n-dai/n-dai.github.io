# Hello guys, this is my first blog

I've learnt this so far about fastai:

Fastai is library that is built on top of PyTorch. It is a high level deep learning library, aiming to make deep learning more accessible by providing an abstracted workflow for common tasks. Fastai simplifies the process of training deep learning models, handing the data loading, pre-processing, model architecture selection, optimisation and evaluation.

An example of this can be seen below, from the website of the fastai course online.

## **Code converted to fastai**

As I have been using fastai to complete my assignment, I have noticed the ease of use with the program. Tasked with scraping Duck Duck Go to find images of 10 animal classes, then to classify them, I followed a tutorial provided. By using fastai functions such as *vision_learner()* and *fine_tune()*, I was able to achieve an accuracy of ~88%, which is highly accurate. The results are provided below.

## From here...
I am now tasked with designing a deep learning model to classify whether an image is fake or real, updates of this endeavour will be posted in future posts.

Thanks for dropping by!
