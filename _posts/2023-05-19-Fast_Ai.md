# Hello guys, this is my first blog

I've learnt this so far about fastai:

Fastai is library that is built on top of PyTorch. It is a high level deep learning library, aiming to make deep learning more accessible by providing an abstracted workflow for common tasks. Fastai simplifies the process of training deep learning models, handing teh data loading, pre-processing, model architecture selection, optimisation and evaluation.
